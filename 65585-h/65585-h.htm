  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In this volume, as in the preceding, an effort has
been made to give the reader some idea of the
actual conditions of the printing industry in Europe
from the time of the invention down to the French
Revolution. Attention has been devoted to the organization
and conditions of the industry, the circumstances
under which the work was done, and the
actual life and work of the men who did it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The method of treatment chosen has been topical
rather than chronological. It has been thought that
a series of pictures of different aspects of the industry
would be of more value than the ordinary detailed
study of periods, of schools, and of the actual work
produced at various times which is rather suited to
advanced students than to beginners. This method
of treatment necessarily involves a certain amount of
repetition, but probably less than would be required
if an attempt were made to fit the same information
into a chronological framework.</p>

<p class='c007'>To an extent even greater than in the previous
volume the writer has endeavored to reconstruct in
part at least the general conditions of the time. The
economic history of printing or, indeed, any history of
printing is a part of the general history of the period.
It so happens that the peculiar conditions of the printing
industry had a very marked effect in the changes
which took place in the industrial world in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. The attempt is made
to show the working of these influences in the treatment
of certain parts of the subject. The main purpose,
however, throughout has been to give the young printer
of today an idea of the work and life of the old printers,
who were very human men, engaged, though under different
conditions, in the same struggle to earn their
bread and butter which occupies our attention today.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>We turn now to a study of the printing industry
in some aspects concerning the industry as a
whole, rather than the life and work of the
great printers. A very large part of what follows will
be found to deal with conditions in France. This
happens because the study has been far better worked
out for France than for any other country. While
much incidental information is to be obtained from
other histories, Mellotté’s <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire Economique de l’Imprimerie</span></cite>
stands alone as a study of the printing
industry from this point of view. Unfortunately it
concerns only France and ends with the French Revolution
of 1789. Conditions in France, however, were
not greatly different from those existing elsewhere and
for that reason the study which follows, based largely
on Mellotté’s work, will give a fairly accurate idea of
the condition of the industry in general. It is to be
regretted that Mellotté’s book has not been translated
into the English as it is a mine of information of great
interest and value to all students of the industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the printing industry is hardly intelligible
unless one begins with a general understanding
of the industries of the Middle Ages and the organization
of those who were engaged in them. When
Gutenberg practiced printing there was no such thing
in the world as a factory. Perhaps the nearest approach
to one might be found in some royal arsenal,
shipyard, or mint where certain industries were carried
on on a large scale. The day of invention had not
yet dawned. Machinery, except of the most primitive
types, did not exist. Consequently, industrial and
social conditions were different in every respect from
those which now prevail.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The work of the Middle Ages was hand-work carried
on by a small group of workmen living in the household
of the master; in other words it was what we call
today household industry. Very often there was no
one engaged in the work except the master and his
family. Sometimes he had an apprentice or two.
Master workmen usually employed as many apprentices
as they could use. The apprentices paid for the
privilege of learning the trade. As we shall see presently,
the knowledge of a trade and admission to the
ranks of the master workmen was a privilege very well
worth paying for.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apprenticeship indenture or agreement was a
contract covering a certain number of years, usually
seven. During this period the apprentice was obliged
to work for the master to the best of his ability, to be
careful of the master’s goods, and to be subject in every
way to his personal control, a control which extended
to the infliction of corporal punishment if the apprentice
were idle or disobedient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master was bound to teach the apprentice his
trade so that if the apprentice used due diligence he
might at the end of his agreement qualify as a journeyman.
He was obliged to furnish him board and lodging
in his own (the master’s) home, to keep him decently
clothed and, especially toward the end of the period,
to give him a small wage for pocket money. We shall
look a little closer at this matter of apprenticeship in a
later chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The masters themselves were organized into guilds.
These guilds were a combination of what we now know
as trade unions and employers’ associations. Everybody
connected with the trade in a regular and legal
manner belonged to the guild. In some cases the
master workman became so prosperous that he employed
a considerable number of other master workmen
and devoted his time to superintendence, but whether
he were in this way an ancestor of a modern captain of
industry or were at the other end of the scale, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>apprentice just under indenture, he was recognized as
part and parcel of the trade guild. If he were not free
of the guild he was not permitted to work at the
industry excepting as an employee. As we shall see,
there grew up in this way an intermediate class of hired
workmen who were neither apprentices nor masters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The guilds acted very honestly and conscientiously
in the interests of both the public and the trade. While
they monopolized the industry, restricted the number
of persons engaged in it, and permitted no outside
competition, they guaranteed the quality of workmanship
and product. A guild member putting inferior
goods upon the market or in any way detracting from
the workmanlike standards of the guild was liable to
severe penalties, and as a rule these penalties were
conscientiously inflicted.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A more detailed account of the guilds will be found in Chapter V.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The introduction of printing raised new questions.
Printing did not fit into this scheme of things for several
reasons. As a newly discovered art it did not properly
belong to any of the known industries, which had
gradually become consolidated into strong guilds. The
printers, therefore, found themselves outside the recognized
trade law.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were, therefore, taken in hand by the authorities
until such time as their own trade organization
developed. Not only was the printing trade outside
the guild organizations, but it was different from them
in several important principles. In the first place, it
was from the beginning a machine occupation; in the
second place, it involved division of labor; and in the
third place, it dealt with a product entirely different
from that of the other craftsmen. The dawn of the
printing industry was the dawn of an age of machinery
in production. The product of the printing press was
not simply an article of consumption. There is no
comparison between a piece of cloth or a pair of shoes
and a book. The book is a source of information and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>enlightenment, or the reverse. It may stir men to the
ecstasies of devotion or incite them to rebellion or
unsettle the foundations of their religious faith. It may
serve the highest interests of mankind or it may be in
the last degree dangerous to the church, the state, and
the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Obviously, to the fifteenth century mind everything
called for the regulation of the industry. The fifteenth
century, like those which immediately preceded it,
was an age of regulation. The idea of the freedom of
commerce and industry, so dear to the modern political
economist, had not yet been conceived. All industry
was subject to the most minute regulations partly
imposed by the state and partly imposed by the guild.
All the concerns of human life were subject to regulation,
including even what people in different ranks of
life should eat, drink, and wear. As there was no trade
organization to regulate printing, of course it became
immediately the subject of governmental interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely had the art of printing appeared when the
governmental rights of regulation were invoked to
destroy it, fortunately without success. Most important
inventions deprive certain workmen of their occupation.
The invention of printing was no exception.
It necessarily meant the economic ruin of the copyists
and threatened the illuminators. By the middle of the
fifteenth century the copying of books had to a considerable
extent come out of the monasteries and
become a regular occupation. In 1472 there were in
France ten thousand of these copyists, to say nothing
of the illuminators. These copyists were organized
into guilds with charter rights and a definite legal
position. Seeing their livelihood threatened, they
attempted in every way to prevent the introduction of
printing. They invoked their charter rights and
attempted to protect themselves thereby against the
invasion of their field by the printer. Not only that,
but they were probably back of the popular clamor
which raised the accusation of witchcraft against Fust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and drove him out of Paris in 1465. Their opposition,
however, was unsuccessful. A few of them retained
their work. For a long time the manuscript book
retained the esteem which is so often felt for hand work
as compared with machine work. Long after the
invention of printing there were many eminent collectors
of books who would not have a printed book in
their libraries. To this day there are a few people who
live by engrossing and illuminating, although not
generally by the copying of books.</p>

<p class='c007'>An admirable illustration of the beauties and disadvantages
of this kind of work may be found in the
Congressional Library at Washington. There is there
displayed in a series of frames a very wonderful engrossed
and illuminated copy of the Constitution of
the United States. The text is beautifully engrossed
and the illuminated borders and the illustrations are
in the finest style of modern art. At first sight it is a
wonderful piece of work, but it requires but a slight
examination to see that the text is full of errors. Words
are omitted and misspelled so that the whole thing is
practically worthless so far as its content is concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few of the copyists became printers. Probably the
greater number of them lost their distinctive occupation
and became absorbed in some way or other into
other industries or, if they were too old for this, suffered
the evils incident to permanent loss of occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The illuminators at first made common cause with
the copyists. Before long, however, they discovered
that the copyists were making a hopeless fight and that
their own occupation had a chance of surviving.
They, therefore, for the most part went over to the
printers and found occupation in the new industry,
either directly in their old occupations as illuminators
or in slightly modified form as illustrators. Many of
the early books show hand-illuminated capitals and
some show illuminated margins and hand-painted
illustrations equal to those of the finest manuscripts.
It was, however, only the more expensive books which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>were separately hand-illustrated. The field of book
illustration, substantially as we know it through the
medium of pictures mechanically reproduced, was soon
developed and offered a large field for the exercise of
artistic ability and taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kings and rulers generally favored printing as a
means of spreading intelligence. The fifteenth century
kings, unlike some of a little later period, were believers
in education and patrons of learning and the arts.
They had not yet come to see that their thrones, or at
least their prerogatives, might be threatened by learning,
and therefore they did their best to encourage it.
Among all these royal patrons of printing, Francis I of
France is the most conspicuous. When he first came
to the throne he was under the influence of those who
were hostile to the new art and attempted to stifle it
by stringent legislation. An edict of his issued in 1534
prohibits printing on pain of hanging for the offender.
Exactly why King Francis took so positive a position
is not clear, but fortunately he very soon changed his
mind and repealed the edict. From this time forward
he did everything in his power to encourage printing
and printers, as we have already seen in recounting the
history of the Estienne family. In 1536 he made an
arrangement, the first of the kind, to have a copy of
every book that was printed filed in the Royal Library.
In 1538 he favored the printers by granting them an
edict of exemption from service in the City Guard, a
service to which residents generally were liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>During King Francis’s reign labor troubles arose in
the industry. Enough references have already been
made to show that the strike is by no means a modern
institution and that strikes in printing offices are pretty
nearly as old as the industry. There were strikes, some
of them of a rather serious nature, among the Parisian
printers in the reign of King Francis. As soon, however,
as it appeared that they were liable to injure the
industry or interfere seriously with the work of the
master printers the king suppressed them by a heavy-handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>use of the royal authority, insisting that trade
disputes must not be allowed to interfere with the
successful prosecution of the industry and that the
journeymen must not be permitted by strikes to put
a stop to the operations of their employers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1585 King Henry III of France issued an edict
relieving printers from the application of a general
edict taxing artisans. This action was based on the
ground that the work of the printer was so far superior
in character to that of other mechanics that the
printer was not to be regarded as a mechanic at all.
He was formally recognized as being in a social class
above the members of the trade guilds and almost, if not
quite, in the class of gentlemen. Of course, we are
speaking now in terms of the sixteenth century and not
of the twentieth.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an incident of this recognized social superiority
the printer was permitted to wear a sword, a right
which was denied to artisans generally. The old prints
showing the interiors of print shops almost invariably
show at least one of the workmen wearing a sword, or
show a sword conspicuously displayed standing against
a pillar or the wall. The introduction of the sword
into these pictures is deliberately done to indicate the
social pretensions of the printer of this period. It is
worth remembering because although it involves a
certain artificial social distinction which we now consider
rather absurd it also involves certain principles
which we should do well not to lose sight of. In those
days printing was regarded as a profession rather than
strictly a trade, and the printer was deeply impressed
with the value and importance of his work, a value and
importance which were not only claimed by him but
recognized by his fellow citizens. It was very strongly
felt that a man who made a book was engaged in a
much more important piece of work than a man who
made a pair of shoes or forged a sword. The more of
this spirit of self respect, the more of this recognition
of the importance of printing and the printed product
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>we can recover today, the better off we shall be.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the beginning printers were troubled by
typographical errors. Some of the earlier printers,
like Caxton and Gehring, had their books corrected
by hand after they were printed. As a rule, however,
the modern practice of more or less careful proof
reading preceded publication. There were constant
complaints of inaccuracy, especially on the part of the
cheap printers and the printers of pirated editions.
The influence of the better printers and the insistent
demands of the public finally brought about a reasonable
degree of textual accuracy. It is interesting to note
that royal regulation attempted to deal with this
matter as it dealt with so many other things.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles IX of France issued an edict in 1592 the vital
portion of which read as follows: “The said Masters
shall furnish copies carefully edited, corrected, and
made clear to the compositors lest through default of
this their labor be hindered.” The principle underlying
the edict was a good one. It is certainly in the
interest of all concerned that compositors should be
furnished good copy. There is unfortunately every
reason to believe that the efforts of this royal champion
of copy editing were not attended with very much
success.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1618 Louis XII organized the corporation of
printers which will be discussed later. Louis XIV reaffirmed
the preceding edicts governing and regulating the
industry, and his great minister Colbert, in 1686, issued
certain new regulations. In these it was provided that
every shop should have a minimum equipment of two
presses well provided with type. This was probably
intended to put a stop to the small shops which did
poor work and were very difficult to regulate under the
police regulations which will be later discussed. The
number of shops in Paris was fixed by this edict at 36.
Private printing—that is to say, the exercise of the
industry by persons not members of the Community
of Printers—was absolutely forbidden. The quality of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the work put out was insisted upon under severe
penalties in case proper standards were not maintained.
The long standing disagreement between booksellers
and printers was settled by a decision that booksellers
could not be members of the Community of Printers,
unless they were themselves printers. The bookseller,
pure and simple, who was merely a dealer in books was
thus barred out of the Community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis XVI, the last king of the old regime, went still
further in the matter of the regulation of journeymen.
By his regulations every journeyman printer was
obliged to register with the public authorities, to take
out an identification card, and to have his domicile
legally fixed and registered with the public authorities.
He could not obtain employment without showing his
card and could not change his residence without
notifying the public authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1789 came the Revolution which swept away all
the edicts regulating printing. In this ruin royal
regulation, trade organization, police supervision, and
every other restraint on the trade went down together.
Printing was unregulated and unlicensed. As an
actual result there came a flood of printing of a very
low character both mechanically and morally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some great houses like that of Didot stood fast by
the old standards, but small printing houses flourished
and the unregulated condition of the trade was in many
respects most unfortunate. In the long run, however,
economic laws asserted themselves as they always do.
The establishment of a settled government under
Napoleon and the reassertion of the old laws of libel
and the like put a stop to some of the worst extravagances.
At a later period, the growth and development
of unions of the modern type has had its influence everywhere
and the industry has at last come into its own,
unhampered by artificial regulations and unrestrained
by ill-advised attempts to prevent abuses which can
better be dealt with by general statutes applying to all
industries and by the operation of economic law.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Privileges and Monopolies</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The governmental regulations just described were
similar to those imposed upon all trades. The
product of the printing press, however, was not like
that of other manufacturing establishments. The
use of books is clearly different from the use of ordinary
manufactured products. The modern printing press
puts out a flood of material which is temporary in its
nature. Much of it never gets read at all and comparatively
little of it is considered as of permanent value.
The early presses, however, turned out books almost
entirely. Practically the whole product was of permanent
value. It could be easily imitated, and in many
cases the imitation could be produced at much less
expense than the original as the imitation involved no
labor of editors and compilers. Again, communication
in those days was very difficult and freight rates were
high. If a book could be reprinted freely by anyone
who got hold of it, a book printed in a given place could
be sold much cheaper than one brought from a distance.
For example, a Paris printer could not compete with a
Lyons printer in Lyons provided the latter were permitted
to print the same books as the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was another far more important difference.
The products of the printing press materially affected
the human mind and through it influenced human
action. When men began to read and printed matter
began to be cheap and plenty, the individual in particular
and the state at large entered an entirely new
phase of existence. Minds of men might be filled with
information or misinformation, with noble or with base
desires and purposes, with high thoughts or low by the
products of the press. They might be roused to
patriotic action or stirred to rebellion. Their religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>might be deepened, altered, or destroyed. Immense
and unimaginable influence might be and, as soon
appeared, was exerted by this new agency.</p>

<p class='c007'>These facts gave rise to certain problems peculiar to
the industry. What right had the publisher to control
his product and be protected against a ruinous competition
from other printers? Had he any such right at all?
Had the author any right to control the printing,
publishing, and sale of his works? Had he any right to
be secured in the receipt of some remuneration? How
could that right be protected? Was the printing
press to be allowed to pour out anything its owners
pleased, regardless of its effect upon citizenship,
religion, or morals, or should the product be controlled
so as to secure the helping and not the hurting of
mankind? If it was to be controlled, who was to decide
upon the measures and standards of control, and on
what ground? What was helpful and what was harmful?</p>

<p class='c007'>The attempted solution of these problems, of course,
grew out of the accepted commercial usages of the
time. Patents and copyrights as we now know them,
regulated by general laws and accessible to all inventors
and authors, were unknown. Their place was taken
by monopolies which, as we shall see, sometimes had
much the same effect as a modern patent or copyright.</p>

<p class='c007'>A monopoly, sometimes called a privilege, was a grant
to a certain person of the sole right to sell or to
manufacture a certain thing, to trade in a certain
locality, or do something of a similar nature. Monopolies
survive today in certain countries, though mainly
as governmental monopolies; for example, in Italy the
sale of matches is a governmental monopoly. No
individual is allowed to sell them except as a government
agent, and the traveler is not allowed to take
any across the frontier, even in his pocket. In Russia
the sale of vodka was a governmental monopoly until
the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, when its sale
was prohibited. In the middle ages, however, private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>monopolies were very common. It is important to know
that these monopolies or privileges were literally what
the latter name indicates. Very often they were given
to royal favorites as a means for their personal
enrichment. They were purely acts of grace and
did not imply any recognition of right on the part
of the person to whom they were granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those trades which could not obtain the protection
of monopoly attempted to protect themselves when
possible by trade secrets. This was a much more
important protection in those days than it would be
now. Combinations and processes, tricks of the trade
which had been discovered experimentally by some
clever workman, could hardly be discovered by his
rivals unless they could hit upon the same thing by
a tedious course of experimentation or could in some
way secure betrayal of the secret. Very few trade
secrets can be hidden from modern science, but modern
science did not exist in the fifteenth century. The
apprentice was sworn not to betray his master’s
secrets, and the consequences of such betrayal were
very serious. As we have already seen, Gutenberg at
first attempted to keep printing a trade secret, but the
obvious impossibility of doing so led to other methods
of protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately for the new art the great men of the
time were interested in it and, as a rule, it was not
difficult to obtain a certain amount of protection by
privilege. Venice was perhaps the most advanced
state in Europe in the middle of the fifteenth century,
certainly it was one of the most advanced. The intelligent
business men and astute nobles trained in public
affairs who made up the body of citizens of the Republic
of Venice were not slow in perceiving that a condition
had arisen which must be immediately attended to.
The matter was therefore taken up by the Council of
Ten, an executive body which had large functions in
the government of Venice. Their methods of dealing
with the matter may be divided into four heads.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The first was the monopoly under which only one
printer was allowed to work in a given town. Such a
monopoly was granted John of Spire who, in 1469, was
given the sole privilege of doing printing in Venice.
Fortunately the unwisdom of this particular method
of protection was soon seen and other printers were
allowed in Venice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next was a form of privilege something like the
modern copyright. Under this a publisher or even an
author was granted the sole right to print or cause to be
printed a certain book. The first one of these copyrights
was issued to Antonio Sabellico in 1486. Sabellico
was the official historian of Venice and the copyright
covered his history. Unlike modern copyrights,
which cover but a single book, these privileges might
cover anything that an author had written or might
write. It is clear that such a blanket copyright in the
hands of a publisher might be used very injuriously,
and there is evidence that they were so used either to
extort money or to impede publication. It is probable
that in many cases this form of privilege involved some
arrangement between the author and the printer whereby
the author shared the profits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Copyright privileges ran from one to twenty-five
years and were sometimes extended. Not infrequently
copyright privileges were issued with limiting clauses
or conditions, such as that the books should be sold at
a “fair price,” that the work copyrighted should be
published within a year, or that a certain number of
copies should be printed per week, and the like.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third method of protection was by a privilege
like a modern patent, covering certain processes or
certain kinds of printing. For example: Aldus was
granted the sole right to use the italic character, while
others were given the sole right of printing in some
foreign language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth method was the absolute prohibition of
the importation of books printed outside the territories
of the Republic. This was coupled with the refusal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>copyright privileges to all books not printed in Venice.
Of course, in this whole discussion we must understand
that Venice was not the modern city, but the medieval
state, which at times was of considerable extent.</p>

<p class='c007'>This system had certain rather serious defects in
practice. In the first place the Council of Ten which issued
all these privileges, although usually an extremely
businesslike body, kept no record of its relations
with printers. Probably this was not a serious matter
for the first few years, but the time soon came when
no member of the Council could remember what
privileges had been granted either to printers or authors.
Consequently privileges were very liable to duplication
and the Council finally got out of the difficulty by
issuing its copyrights with the proviso “If no previous
copyright has been issued.” This was very comfortable
for the Council, but rather uncomfortable for the
printer, because it threw upon him the burden of finding
out facts which were nowhere on record. Again,
there was no machinery for the enforcement of the privileges.
While it is probable that legal proceedings
could be instituted under them, some other machinery
ought to have been provided to make them effective.
Lastly, and this was, as we shall see, a common difficulty
with all early privileges, they were very narrow
in application. Privileges applied only to the territory
of Venice and were worthless elsewhere. As we have
seen in the case of Aldus, the products of the Venetian
press were sold throughout the civilized world, but outside
of their place of production they were unprotected
by any copyright or other defence. In some cases they
were excluded by protective laws similar to those by
which Venice attempted to secure her printers from
foreign competition. At a somewhat later period some
difficulty arose because of the claims of the Papal
Court to issue privileges outside of the States of the
Church. On the whole, however, the Venetian system
was about the best and the simplest of the early systems
for dealing with the problems of the printing press.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Turning next to Germany, we find that practically
all of the books printed from 1450 to 1500 were reprints
of old books. The literary pirate made his appearance
almost as soon as the printer appeared. We
have already seen that Fust himself was the first of
the brood. The fact is not surprising, however, when
we remember the conditions of the time. The idea of
property in a book excepting as one particular object, a
piece of furniture so to speak, never occurred to anybody.
Throughout the entire period of manuscript
books it was everywhere held that any man who had
possession of a book, even temporarily, had a right to
copy it. That the owner of the book had any right to
control its duplication, even though he had been at
great expense to make a copy, was not considered
worth discussion. If a man could copy a manuscript
which had cost a hundred crowns to make, might he
not reprint a book which cost less than one tenth of
that amount? It was held that ownership of a printed
book carried with it the same rights of reproduction
which had from time immemorial been attached to
ownership of a written book.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men who wrote books wrote for the love of it. There
was no such thing as authorship as a profession and no
such thing as the sale of an author’s work, except so
far as the books themselves were concerned. It is
true that certain writers were helped and perhaps
supported by wealthy patrons of literature in the old
world or by rich men and politicians who were willing
to pay for verses or pamphlets eulogizing their names
and praising their exploits. Doubtless, there were
writers who lived by their wits in this way, but their
case was far different from that of the modern author
who either sells his work to a publisher or makes a
contract for a royalty. If a man was paid for writing
a poem in praise of his patron neither he nor
his patron was supposed to control the poem; in a
word, there was no conception of any kind of literary
property, and the printers soon found that there must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>property in books or printing would become impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Germany, like Venice, undertook to deal with the
matter by the privilege system, although German
privileges seem to have been less varied and more
simple than those of the Venetians and to have concerned
themselves more exclusively with the printer,
to the neglect of the author. As elsewhere, a privilege
was the sole right to print a work or a series of works in
a given place. The peculiar political condition which
existed in Germany made this a rather difficult matter.
Germany in the fifteenth century consisted geographically
of what is now the Empire of Germany, the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.
It was composed of a great number of states
of very different sizes, from a single city up to a reasonably
large country. Each one of these cities had a
large degree of self government. They were all supposed
to be governed by the emperor. He was called
the Holy Roman Emperor and was supposed to be the
heir of the old emperors of Rome. He governed
largely through assemblages of the princes, called
Diets, which were held wherever and whenever the
emperor called them. There were also certain imperial
courts and governing councils. All this elaborate
scheme of government existed largely on paper. It
was not generally strong enough to govern effectively,
but was generally strong enough to keep things more
or less in confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The power of the emperor depended to a considerable
extent upon his personal character and his private
resources. An emperor who happened to be a strong
man, governing a powerful state in the empire from
which he could draw money and military support,
could hold the states, which were liable to be extremely
unruly, in their places and could collect the imperial
revenue. A man of weaker personality or without
the backing of such private resources could neither
keep the turbulent princes in order nor collect the
revenue.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The local princes had no sooner begun to issue
privileges than the emperor began to do the same
thing. A local privilege was not good beyond the limits
of the small state which issued it. An imperial privilege
was theoretically good throughout the empire, but
practically good only in spots. If it conflicted with a
local privilege, or the local authority happened to be
on bad terms with the emperor it would be worthless.
The result of all of this was that at a very early period
the printers of Germany got together and made a sort
of “gentleman’s agreement,” as we say today, to respect
each other’s undertakings. This agreement was
practically the best protection of the German book
trade until the development of copyright laws at a
very much later period. It appears to have been
relied upon by the printers more than was the privilege.
Privileges were often obtained, partly because it was
desirable to keep on good terms with the local authorities
and partly because of the relation of privilege
to censorship, which we shall discuss later, but it is
clear that printing in Germany would have suffered
greatly if it had not been for the existence of the “live
and let live” agreement of the German printers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Printers’ privileges covered only old books. New
books unless covered by some author’s privilege were
not covered at all, presumably on the ground that in
those days, before author’s rights to compensation were
fully recognized, the expense and risk of producing
the classics for a comparatively small market was
greater than that of printing new books, especially as
many of the new books were controversial and the
authors paid the printers. Until about 1800 the
printer was a much more important personage in
legislation than the author. There was practically
very little protection of literary rights of authors
excepting what came through privileges, and the
printer’s privileges were considered much more important
than the author’s rights. Privileges covered:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>(a) Public documents, including church books and
school books.</p>

<p class='c007'>(b) The first printing of books from the body of the
world’s literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>(c) New books which were first treatments of some
specific subject, generally scientific, technical, or practical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The granting of a privilege often carried with it exemption
from taxation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conditions in France were not greatly different from
those in Italy and Germany, although France dealt
with the problem by means of privileges only and had
her problem somewhat simplified by unified administration
over a large territory. The first privilege to be
issued in France was granted Antoine Verrard in 1507
for an edition of the Epistles of Paul with a French
commentary. French privileges were sometimes issued
to printers for a single work and sometimes for all the
works which they might print. They ran from two
to ten years. They might be general, covering the
whole kingdom, or they might be local, covering a single
province or district. For example, one might have the
exclusive privilege of printing certain books or the
books of a certain author for ten years, or another
might have the privilege of printing anything of a
certain sort in the city of Lyons for five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is understood, of course, that a privilege implied
prohibition. If a man had a privilege for the works of
an author throughout France that meant that no one
else in France could print the same books. If he had
the privilege for all that he wanted to print in Lyons
it meant that nobody else in Lyons could print those
books, although anybody outside of Lyons could print
them freely. The French law contained one provision
which does not appear elsewhere, namely that licenses
could be revoked before they expired. They were
occasionally issued to persons not residents of France,
another provision which appears to have been peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to the French law. A third peculiarity is that privileges
were occasionally given to authors for the control of
their works, but without the right to print them or to
sell them. In such a case as that the printer would
have to get another privilege to print and sell the books.
He would have to pay the author for the right to do so.
The question of privilege in France, like the question
of censorship, which we shall soon take up, was greatly
complicated by the multiplication of authorities and
consequent conflict and confusion. Privileges might
be issued by the king, by the Parliament of Paris
(a misleading name, as the Parliament of Paris was a
judicial and not a legislative body), by the University
of Paris, and by the Provost of Paris. The tendency in
all things French, however, from early in the 15th
century to the French Revolution was toward the
concentration of power, so that the right to issue
privileges was gradually concentrated in the hands of
the king.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>To the mind of the fifteenth or sixteenth century
man the protection of church and state and of the
public was a very much more important matter than
the protection of the printer or the author, and it was
seen that the printing press might easily distill a
venom which would poison the minds of men and
threaten the health of institutions. Measures to
prevent this occurrence went hand in hand with the
granting of privileges. It was only natural that they
should do so as they might well be regarded as conditions
upon which the privilege should be granted, or,
as the idea developed, upon which the trade should
be exercised. France early decreed that every piece
of printing put out in the kingdom must be certified as
“containing nothing contrary to faith, good manners,
public peace, and the royal authority.” Theoretically,
nothing could be more admirable. Doubtless many of
us today would like to be assured that all printed
matter should meet these requirements. It is obvious,
however, that such regulations were liable to work
very badly in practice. What constitutes faith, good
manners, public peace, and the royal authority? These
are, to a considerable extent, matters of opinion. It
may happen that the royal authority becomes tyranny
and ought to be opposed rather than supported. In
the hands of the narrow-minded, ignorant, and unscrupulous,
censorship laws may easily open the way
to intolerable abuses. As a matter of fact, they have
only too often done so, and it is for that reason that we
in the United States today insist upon freedom of the
press.</p>

<p class='c007'>Possible injury to the faith was very early perceived
by the church. As guardian of the faith and morals of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the people, the church felt constrained to see that
nothing with heretical or immoral tendencies should
be placed in the hands of the faithful. Just as Venice
led the way in laws relating to privilege, so she was
prominent in the matter of censoring books. Usually
the body which issued licenses had charge of the
censorship as well. It might not distrust the ecclesiastical
examination and censoring of the books, but
it made the censorship effective by its refusal of
privilege. Later, as we shall see, when this procedure
did not prove entirely effective other methods were
taken to punish the printers and the authors of books
which were deemed injurious. The first book which
appeared with the approval of the ecclesiastical authorities
was printed in 1480. This approval at first had
nothing to do with the privilege to print, but was
rather a commendation to the attention of the faithful.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1487, however, the Pope (Innocent VIII) issued
a bull against objectionable books. This bull was
addressed to the States of the Church, Italy, Germany,
France, Spain, England, and Scotland. As a result,
probably, of this bull, Venice enacted a requirement in
1508 that the approval of the Church should precede
the granting of any privilege to print. In 1515 the
Lateran Council established the principle of strict
censorship. The religious troubles of the sixteenth
century had much to do with the application of this
principle. In the Protestant countries it was applied
much less vigorously than in the Catholic countries.
It must not be understood, however, that the Protestants
had any broader or more intelligent views on the
subject of censorship than the Catholics had. They
were just as ready to recognize the principle of censorship
and apply it, but the occasions for applying it were,
or seemed to be, less frequent. Venice, although always
a Catholic country, was careful to keep herself as
independent of Rome as possible. The Venetians
consequently kept the reins in their own hands with
regard to the censorship of books as well as in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>matters, although they co-operated with the church
authorities and offered no hindrances to the work
of the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1503 Venice extended the scope of censorship to
cover the literary quality of books and translations,
the political effect of books, and their effect upon
morals. The political and moral censorship appears
to have been less effective than the religious and
literary. In 1547 the Inquisition took charge of the
censorship of books and the punishment of those who
offended against the press laws, and continued to
exercise those functions until 1730. It is interesting to
note that the greatest activity of the Inquisition was
in the first half century of its work, a period when
religion was still the subject of bitter controversy and
bloody warfare. The Inquisition took cognizance of
132 cases between 1547 and 1600. Between 1600 and
1700, however, it only dealt with 55, while from 1700
to 1730 it dealt with only four.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1571 Pope Pius V started the Index Expurgatorius.
This Index was and is a list wherein are
registered books and other publications which are
condemned by the Commission in charge of it, called
the Congregation of the Index, as being immoral and
unsound either in religion or politics. By this means
the church undertakes to protect its members from
the reading of books calculated to injure their morals
or to unsettle their faith.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lines of legislation in Venice regarding censorship
ran in certain very definite directions, namely: the
legalizing of custom and precedent, protection of the
industry against foreign competition and preservation
of the excellence of the nation’s press, protection of the
buyer of books against poor workmanship and excessive
charges (protection of the author’s right has already
been discussed), and the development of a Bureau to
administer the press laws and regulate the industry.
In 1549 the book trade was organized by the creation
with definite legal recognition of the Guild of Printers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and Booksellers. It was believed that the trade could
be dealt with better and could do its own work better
if it were organized.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purpose of the guild was three-fold:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. To protect trade interests—the purpose of trade
organizations at all times.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. To assist the state and church in watching the
output of the press.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. To suppress pernicious books.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the years went by the tendency was for the
state censorship to relax and for the church censorship
to become more severe. In time the censorship became
very harassing and very troublesome. In 1671,
although the Inquisition had ceased to be very active in
dealing with the enforcement of press censorship laws,
the requirements preliminary to printing a book were
so severe that one wonders that printing existed at all.
If a man wanted to print a book in Venice at that
time he had to secure the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A testamur (a sort of approval) from the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A testamur from the Ducal Secretary.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A certificate from the University of Padua.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Permission to print from the Council of Ten.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Revision of his work by the superintendent of
the press.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Revision of his proofs by the public proof reader.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Collation of the original text with the printed
text by the representative of the University.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. A certificate by the Librarian of Saint Marks
that a copy of the book had been deposited in the
Library.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Examination by government experts to fix the
price.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost every one of these processes had to be paid
for. Italy outside Venice was strongly influenced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Rome and the press was comparatively strictly controlled
by the influence of the church.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Germany, on the contrary, the censorship was
probably the least severe of any on the Continent.
As already noted, there was substantially no printing
of original work in Germany until 1500 and consequently
no special need of censorship. Shortly afterward
Germany was rent in twain by religious dissensions.
It must be remembered that the Reformation,
being very largely a political movement, the difference
between Catholics and Protestants followed geographical
lines for the most part. There were comparatively
few Protestants in Catholic countries or Catholics in
Protestant countries. The Protestants seized  upon
the printing press as a method of propaganda. They
consequently advocated its freedom and encouraged
its use. The Catholics at first attempted to defend
themselves from this attack by the suppression of
printing and the destruction of imported books. After
a little time, however, with greater wisdom, they
themselves made use of the printing press for a counter
propaganda. Those who were disturbed by the censorship
in a country in either camp could and did move to
one in the other. In this way unless a man had religious
opinions which were unacceptable anywhere or
wished to publish books which were seditious or immoral
it would be entirely easy for him to find a place
where he could be undisturbed and probably encouraged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early assertion of government control in France
has already been described. Francis I, although a
good friend of printing, was a loyal son of the church,
and all the more so because of his unfriendly relations
with Henry VIII of England who, for much of his life,
was not on good terms with the church. Francis, therefore,
issued edicts in 1521 enforcing the censorship
which was called for by the decree of the Lateran
Council already referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>This censorship was exercised by a considerable
number of persons. This was always a defect in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>French press laws and was the cause of a great deal of
difficulty and hardship. At first censorship was exercised
by the bishops, by the Faculty of Theology of
the University of Paris, by the Parliament of Paris, by
the Royal Chancellor, by the Director-General of the
Book Trade, and by the Lieutenant of Police. Tendencies
to consolidation, however, soon manifested themselves.
The first important step was the centering of
church censorship in the hands of the Faculty of
Theology of the University of Paris to the exclusion of
the bishops generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tendency to centralize was naturally accompanied
by a tendency to tighten the censorship of the
civil authorities, a tendency quite opposite to that
which we observed in Venice. In 1624 a Censor-Royal
was appointed to whom everybody, even the bishops
themselves, was obliged to submit his writing. The
numerous civil authorities having charge of censorship
caused confusion for a time, but gradually their powers
were concentrated in the hands of the Director-General
of the Book Trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The laws were administered by inspectors of bookselling
and enforced by the police and the civil courts.
The laws were very severe. They applied primarily to
the printer and bookseller, probably because he was
an easier person to get at than the author and much
more likely to be financially responsible. The printer
was obliged to make public the name of the author and
printer, the place of manufacture, and the place of
sale of every book which he printed. A printer might
be prosecuted if an authorized book turned out to be
objectionable. This was a particularly unjust law
because the printer was obliged to take the chance that,
after the book had been duly censored and approved
by authority, some censor, perhaps not the one who had
originally approved it, might find something in it
which he considered objectionable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The penalties for infraction of the press laws were
very severe. They consisted of the burning of books,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>confiscation of books, fines, flogging, imprisonment,
banishment, and even burning alive. From 1660 to
1756, 869 authors, printers, and booksellers were sent
to the Bastille. At least one-third of these were
printers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The press laws in France were more severe than
almost anywhere else in Europe. In practical operation
they favored foreign printers at the expense of
the French. Naturally the result of all of this regulation
was that Frenchmen did not print, and the market
was supplied from abroad. If the laws had been strictly
enforced printing would apparently have been driven
out of France. There were, however, certain mitigations.
In the first place certain things were exempt
from the operations of the press laws, such as legal
documents, police papers, documents bearing the
signatures of advocates, and small publications of two
leaves or less for the spread of news or for other purposes.
This particular exemption was always the
cause of a good deal of question and a good deal of
abuse. Again, these laws were largely held in reserve,
that is to say, they made possible the punishment of
offending printers, but in many cases the offender was
not proceeded against unless someone complained.
Again, the judges used large discretion in dealing with
cases of infraction of the press laws. In many cases
licenses were issued in a very informal way, so that
official responsibility was not involved; and sometimes
a clandestine permission was given, the printer being
assured that although his book could not be approved
no action would be taken against him if he published it.
False statements as to place of printing were used as
a means of avoiding responsibility, sometimes apparently
with the connivance of the authorities. The
personal influence of the Chancellor was very great in
these cases, and it was entirely possible for him to
protect authors or writers if he chose to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the eighteenth century the condition had become
practically intolerable. There was a great mass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>laws on the statute books. Legislation was confused
and contradictory and of the most drastic sort. The
enforcement was sporadic and irregular, depending
upon a great many personal and local considerations.
There was no underlying principle to control either
the making or enforcement of the laws. All this, like
so much else that belonged to the life of the old days,
was swept away by the French Revolution. All the
laws regarding privilege, censorship, and the like were
annulled in a mass. The press was given absolute
freedom and left without any control whatever. Of
course, it abused this freedom and the condition of
things for a while was extremely bad. It finally
readjusted itself, however, and gradually settled down
into the condition which is familiar today.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Development of the Idea of Copyright</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>As we have already seen, the early printers concerned
themselves almost exclusively with the
reprinting of church books and the classics. These
last required for successful performance expert editorial
work and proof reading. The printers engaged competent
and sometimes very distinguished scholars to
do this work for them and paid them for their labor.
Out of this practice grew the idea that the author
might properly share in the profits of the original work
done by him. If he were paid for preparing a good
text of Virgil, for instance, why could he not be paid for
writing a critical article to be prefixed to the volume,
and why not if he wrote a whole book about Virgil
which the publisher desired to present to the world of
scholars? At first there was some objection on the
part of the writers themselves. It was held by many
that it was undignified and improper for a writer to
sell his ideas. Such opinions soon ceased to be common.
The race of professional authors living by their pens
came into existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same questions which arose with regard to the
printer’s right to his work extended to the question of
the author’s right. Even before the author’s pecuniary
right in his work was clearly recognized the claim was
asserted that he ought to have control of it. Luther,
for example, strongly asserted this right of control and
strenuously objected to piracy on the ground of his
desire to safeguard the correctness of texts purporting
to be written by him. He does not appear to have
cared for the money, as he himself corrected the texts
of pirated editions of his works. He feared, however,
that harm might come through typographical errors or
even the deliberate falsification of his writing. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>has always been a real danger, and one of the greatest
complaints made by European authors against American
printers previous to the days of international copyright
was on the ground of the incorrectness of the
pirated editions.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the first persons to enjoy anything like copyright
protection in Germany was Albrecht Dürer. The
city government of Nuremberg undertook to protect
Dürer and his family in the right to print and publish his
works. It is a curious mark of the undeveloped state
of public opinion regarding these matters at this time
that Dürer seems to have been protected more as an
inventor than as an author. The early German copyrights
in many cases seem not only to have prevented
others from reprinting a specified book but also from
printing any book on the same subject. For example,
Dürer wrote a book on <cite>Proportion</cite> which was published
in Paris. Before it was completed another
artist named Beham undertook to publish a book on
<cite>Proportion</cite>. Beham was ordered not to publish his
book until after Dürer had completed publication. He
insisted that his work was an absolutely independent
one, not in any way copied from or related to the work
of Dürer, but his plea was disregarded, although, as it
afterward turned out, it was quite true that his work
was entirely independent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout Europe during the period we have under
consideration we find two ideas gradually clearing
themselves from the confused thinking of the time and
coming into recognition. The first is the idea that the
writer of a book has for a time at least property rights
in it, and the other that old books belong to the public.
That is the basis of our modern thinking on the subject.
We recognize that any writer may copyright his work
and is entitled to the control of it during the copyright
period, which varies in different countries. When
his copyright has expired any publisher who cares to
undertake the venture as a business proposition may
bring out an edition and sell it at whatever price he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>chooses. That is the reason why old books are generally
cheaper than new books. An edition of Scott or
Dickens is purely a manufacturing proposition. An
edition of Maurice Hewlett is a very different matter
because Mr. Hewlett, or his publisher, holds copyright
on his works and must be paid for the privilege of
publishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important development in thought was the
growth of the idea of right as distinguished from
privilege. A privilege, as the word implies, is an act
of grace. It is a grant of permission to do a thing which
one has no inherent right to do. In England, as we
shall later see, when the idea of copyright came to be
seriously considered it was based on the common law,
that is to say, it was recognized that the printer and
author had some rights in the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as it was seen that the printer and the
author had produced something more than a mere
piece of merchandise and that the property right of the
producer inhered in that added element quite as much
as in the piece of merchandise the basis was laid for the
common law treatment of the whole matter. The
extension of the conception of property to cover
thoughts as well as things was the basis of the whole
matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a long time before these ideas emerged on the
Continent. It was well to the end of the 18th century
before these matters were clearly understood and
recognized by law. It was not until 1777 that French
law distinctly recognized the difference between old
and new books, and the rights of the author. This
was only twelve years before the French Revolution.
At that time all the old laws were swept away and the
extreme regulation of printing in France gave place
to no regulation at all, which for a time made things
worse than ever. It was not until into the nineteenth
century that the question of copyright has been reasonably
settled. There is still something to be desired
before ideal conditions are reached. Copyright laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of the various nations differ greatly, but on the whole
they fairly accomplish the desired results within the
national boundaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>International copyright rests on the Treaty of Bern
in 1887. The United States was for many years a
great offender in the matter of the recognition of the
rights of foreign authors. At the time of the Treaty of
Bern the United States recognized the principle of
international copyright, but we did not have reasonably
satisfactory legislation on the subject until so
recently as 1909. In this, as in other matters which
we have been discussing and shall discuss in this
volume, very little reference has been made to England
for the reason that a separate volume will be given to
the history of printing in that country.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Trade Guilds and the Coming of The New Industry</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The outstanding factor in the industrial, social, and
economic life of the Middle Ages is the trade guild.
The real life of any people is not the story of its wars or
the record of the doings of its kings and nobles. It is
the life of the people themselves. The moment we try
to study this aspect of these old times we find that in
the towns especially the life of the people centers
around their trade guilds. The guild was an organization
of all the workmen in any given trade. It included
the master workman, the journeyman, and the apprentice.
It controlled the whole life of the industry
from the buying of materials to the selling of the
finished product, from the indenturing of the apprentice
to the certification of the master workman.
Its peculiar strength lay in the fact that it did not
exercise this control in the interest of either the employer
or the employed. It exercised it in the interest
of the industry as a whole. It did not forget the
interests of the public. It did not permit the industry
to be practised by the unauthorized or outsiders. It
limited competition. It distributed labor. It prevented
over-production. It assumed great responsibility for
its members and it held them to a very strict accountability.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, such an organization was possible only
under conditions of production far different from those
which now prevail. All work was hand-work and each
hand-worker was supposed to make the whole of the
thing produced. There were no machines of any
importance and there was practically no division of
labor. The armorer, for example, made his helmet,
carrying it through every process from the first shaping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of the steel to the attaching of the last plume. The
shoemaker selected his leather and carried it through
every process until the shoe was finished. Men learned
trades in those days. They did not learn to tend a
machine. A trade was worth something because the
trade organization of that day made lack of employment
impossible for a decent man in ordinary times.
Learning a trade took a long time. As soon as the boy
was old enough to begin to learn he was apprenticed
to a master workman, usually for a term of seven years.
Usually he paid something for his apprenticeship, in
some cases a considerable amount. He lived in the
master’s family and was supported by him until he was
out of his time. He then usually worked as a journeyman
until he could accumulate the small capital necessary
to set up as an independent master.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been apprenticed under guild regulations to
a guild member he became a member of the guild himself
as soon as he qualified as a journeyman. Meantime
he had not only been thoroughly instructed in the
practice of the industry but he had absorbed the
craftsman’s spirit and become imbued with the great
principles of guild life. These principles were five:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. General protection of workmen. This has perhaps
been sufficiently described already.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Limitation of competition. This has also been
remarked upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Perfection of work.  The guild always stood
behind the quality of the product made by its members.
If goods were not up to standard in quality it was
not only held to be a disgrace to the guild, but the
offending member was liable to severe punishment at
the hands of the guild itself. The guilds maintained
their own inspectors.  These inspectors visited the
shops and the fairs or occasional markets where goods
were sold. If they found poor work in the shop or
if they found that poor work had been put in the
hands of the merchants for sale, they reported it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the guild officers who immediately dealt with the
offending member.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Honesty in business. The guild member not only
made his goods but sold them, generally directly to
the public. Sometimes he sold them to merchants
and sometimes he sent them to certain cities where at
certain times markets or fairs were held, there to be
sold on commission. More often, however, he made
and sold his own goods in his own shop and lived in the
same building with his family, his apprentices, and
sometimes his journeymen. The guild stood for full
weight and measure and for honesty in all business
transactions. It punished faults in these directions as
sternly as in the making of poor goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The maintenance of the social order. The guilds
were always to be found arranged on the side of law
and order, although that did not always mean that
they were on the side of the king or other constituted
authority in periods of civil disturbance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The members of the guilds, all fighting men usually
serving under their own guild banners and their own
leaders, were an important part of the military force of
the medieval cities. Although they might and did
fight on one side or the other of some civic quarrel they
always stood for order in the community just as they
did for honesty in production and trade. This, however,
is closely connected with the further fact that
the guilds had a distinct religious side. The medieval
man was not perhaps very much more religious than
his modern descendant, but he was religious in a
different way and paid much more attention to the
forms of religion. Religious ceremonies formed a part
of the regular routine of guild life and in many cases
special churches were closely identified with certain
guilds. Closely connected with the guilds were organizations
known as confraternities. These confraternities
were religious, charitable, and social organizations.
Although usually drawn from members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>some particular industry, they did not attempt to
exercise the trade control which was in the hands of
the guilds. They adopted the name of some saint who
was chosen as their patron. They had a solemn feast
following attendance at church on his day in the calendar,
and they maintained a fund out of which the needy
could be assisted and the dead buried with due provision
of masses for the repose of his soul in case the
family funds were not sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>You see we are dealing with a time when the lives
of men were very simple, very neighborly, and at least
so far as observance goes, very religious. It is very
important that we should have some fairly clear idea
of these times if we are to understand at all how the
early printers lived, what they did, and why they
did it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries
were the golden age of the guilds. They were at the
height of their power and influence at the period of the
invention of printing. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and
eighteenth centuries were a period of decline. At first
the decline was slow. After the sixteenth century,
however, the decline was rapid, and long before the
end of the eighteenth century the guilds had lost practically
all of their old-time power and influence. In
some portions of Europe the old guild organization
still exists, but its influence is very slight and its purposes
are far different from those of the old organizations
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>This decline was the result of the changing economic
conditions. One of the most important of these was
the development of the modern type of production in
factories using costly equipment and employing large
numbers of men. The old type of production required
little or no capital. There was practically no costly
machinery. The work was done in the master workman’s
house by himself, his sons, and apprentices.
No expensive outlay for materials or plant was required.
The journeyman required practically no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>capital for starting in business beyond his personal
strength and skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Printing was the first industry which could not be
carried on under the old conditions. From the beginning
the printer must have capital to supply type,
presses, and other equipment, to purchase material,
which was costly, and to maintain himself and those
who were working with him while a long process was
being brought to completion and the product marketed.
In order to carry on the business to any advantage a
considerable number of persons must be employed.
Under these circumstances printing was necessarily
from the beginning an enterprise which required the
co-operation of capital and labor to an extent hitherto
unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another reason for the decline of the guilds may be
found in the increasing power of the government and
its progressive control of the citizen. The control and
protection thus exercised by the government rendered
the protection and control exercised by the guild over
its members not only unnecessary but improper.
While in some respects governmental control and the
freedom of a well-organized system of courts did not
protect the rights of the individual and insure the
quality of product as effectively as the guilds had done,
it was inevitable that particular regulations should
give way to general regulation and that the individual
should not only be taught but compelled to look to the
state rather than to an association of individuals for the
protection of his rights and the definition of his duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was probably this more than anything else which
brought about an increasing antagonism between the
guilds and the state in every country. In the years of
their growth and power the guilds, as we have seen,
had been the strong supporters of the social order, the
pillars of the state, and the firm reliance of the government,
or at any rate of that party in the government
which they supported. When the government became
strong enough to desire to stand alone, the power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the guilds, which had formerly been useful, became
decidedly objectionable, and the entire influence of the
state was more and more directed against them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important social change was the development
of free labor and free capital, resulting in the
separation of industrial classes. Under the guild
system there was no separation between labor and
capital, or between the employers and the employed as
classes. The guilds were associations in which labor
and so much capital as there was were combined in a
close organization, while there was neither labor nor
capital in any particular amount outside the guild.
With the gradual change of conditions, growth of
population, increase of wealth, and greater intercourse
between communities there grew up on one end of
the social scale groups of laborers who were not members
of any guild and on the other end accumulations
of capital which were either in the hands of men who
were neither craftsmen nor guild members or of those
who had larger accumulations than they could use in
their own business. This development of laborers seeking
employment and capital seeking investment was
fatal to the guild system when once the progress of
invention made the factory system possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the factors which accelerated this movement
was a curious combination of high prices fixed by the
economic law of supply and demand and low wages
fixed by the ancient law of custom. It must be remembered
that at this time the science of political
economy did not exist. People did not know the laws
which govern business and control prices and wages.
They ignorantly supposed, as some persons still suppose,
that these things may be governed by statute, being
entirely unaware of the fact that they are really the
product of causes for the most part beyond human
control. In the early Middle Ages wages and prices
were fixed on a basis of custom. The three centuries
which formed the golden age of the guilds were a
period of very slight industrial changes. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>no great changes in population. There was no colonizing,
with the consequent opening of new markets.
There were no modern inventions. There was no
particular change in the amount of gold and silver in
circulation. Consequently the law of supply and
demand made itself felt so little through variations in
prices and in wages that it was entirely neglected. It
became the custom to pay a certain amount for each
commodity, and especially to pay a fixed rate of wages
in certain occupations. Nobody thought of paying
less or of asking more than this customary sum. In
case anybody did attempt any modification of this
sort he was promptly checked by law. Attempts were
also frequently made to prevent by law variations in
prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>This condition of things was completely upset by
the changes which took place about the time of the
discovery of America. One of the immediate results
of the opening up of the mines and treasure hoards of
Mexico and Central and South America, with the
consequent enormous increases in the amount of gold
and silver in circulation, was a rise in general prices
of about 100 per cent or, to put it differently, a cutting
in two of the value of gold and silver. Gold and silver
are just like other commodities. When the amount of
gold in a given market is doubled its value is halved;
that is to say, you have to pay twice as much for whatever
you want to buy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opening of new markets and the stimulus given
not only to invention but to production and communication
by the intellectual movement and consequent
discoveries and inventions which were going on at this
time upset industrial conditions tremendously. As
usual, however, the workmen were the last to feel this
change. Men paid more gold for commodities because
they could not get them at the same old price, but
wages for a long period remained fixed by custom.
The laborer, like other people, had to pay more for
what he bought, but unlike other people did not get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>any more for what he sold. This condition was made
even worse by ignorant and sometimes disastrous
attempts to control by legislation a situation which
nobody understood. Statutes to fix prices and curtail
profits are never enforceable unless backed by a
government monopoly of production. Consequently
the extensive legislation for these purposes was useless.
Unfortunately there was also legislation forbidding
combination of workmen, forbidding their passage
from place to place in search of work, and forbidding
their asking or receiving more than the customary
rate of wages. Some of this was old legislation revived.
Some of it was new. While not entirely effective, it
was much more effective than the legislation with
regard to commodity prices, because in the nature of
things it was much more easily enforceable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natural consequence of these conditions was the
disruption of the old economic order. The employer
and employed, who had been associated together in
the old guilds, separated into antagonistic, if not
hostile, camps. Capital and labor instead of co-operating
contested for supremacy. Guilds, if they survived
at all, gradually became associations of masters.
We shall see how this worked out in the development
of the Community of Printers. The workmen gathered
into organizations of their own which were the ancestors
of the modern labor unions. The modern industrial
system with all its power and with all its abuses came
into existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Printing did not fit into the guild system at all.
As has already been pointed out, the very nature of the
industry prevented it. Indeed it was not legally
regarded as an industry or a mechanical occupation
until the great reorganization of the trade in 1618, a
date to which we shall have frequent occasion to refer.
At first it was regarded as an art or profession and
those who practiced it were legally recognized as not
being mechanics and not being liable to the laws
governing mechanics. From 1450 to 1618 the printing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>industry was a sort of industrial outlaw. It was
not under guild control on the one hand and was not
amenable to the general statutes regarding industry
on the other. That meant that the regulations which
were at this period so advantageous to the other industries
did not apply to this one, with numerous unfortunate
results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The industry at first attached itself to the universities.
It was utilized, as we have seen, not for a commercial
purpose as now, but for the production of
Bibles, the classics, and other learned books almost
exclusively. As we have also seen, the universities
attempted to control the output of the press until
more effective methods of censorship were devised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Previous to the invention of typography there had
been a sort of guild of the makers and sellers of books.
In most places this was known as the Confraternity
of St. John the Evangelist, sometimes as the Confraternity
of St. Luke, and in one place at least as the
Brothers of the Pen. This organization continued to
exist as an association of printers, but it did not have
the power and standing of the great trade guilds of an
earlier period. Soon after the invention of printing the
journeymen and apprentices formed an association of
their own, which very soon developed into something
like a labor union. The result of these conditions was
great disorganization in the trade. Strikes were
frequent. In France particularly the period from 1539
to 1544 was one of great disorder. Accounts of a series
of strikes in the city of Lyons at this period read
almost like the accounts of a serious labor disturbance
of the present time. Shops were picketed. There
were parades of strikers. There were riots by the
strikers and their sympathizers, and an appeal to the
town authorities to settle the matter. The settlement
proposed was so unfavorable to the master printers
that they threatened to leave Lyons in a body. This
would have been a very serious matter, as printing was
then one of the great industries of the city, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>disturbance was finally settled by a compromise
which granted the journeymen some of their more
important demands and yet left enough to the masters
so that they felt that they could continue in business.
The great grievances complained of were low pay, poor
food (the journeymen were boarded by their employers),
too many apprentices, and the unwillingness of the
masters to allow them to work at certain times when
they wanted to work, such as on the eves of Sundays
and feast days and the like, and to abstain from work at
certain times when they did not want to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attempts were made to stop the disturbances in the
trade by the intervention of the government. This
intervention was entirely on the side of the masters.
The journeymen were forbidden to do anything whatever
to injure the masters or to impede their business
and they were denied the limitation of apprentices for
which they had asked. Guild regulations limited the
number of apprentices taken in other industries and it
seemed only reasonable to the journeyman that similar
regulations should obtain among the printers, but the
royal authority was constantly exercised against them.
This attempted settlement by royal authority was immediately
followed by still more serious strikes. The
masters complained that the agitation was due to the
pernicious activity of labor leaders and invoked the
royal edicts. The journeymen alleged abuses, claimed
their rights, and undertook to enforce them by combination.
The royal authority was exercised in the
effort to coerce the journeymen even to the point of
threatening by an edict of 1617 that workmen who
interfered with the conduct of their master’s business
should be put to death. This, however, was the last
expiring effort of the old order of things. In the next
year, 1618, a royal edict organized the trade and
prescribed the regulations under which it should be
conducted.</p>

<p class='c007'>This organization, which we shall proceed to study
in detail, was the basis of the conduct of the printing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>industry in France until 1789. It did not bring industrial
peace and it did not remedy all existing evils.
As we shall see, the history of printing is a history of
industrial conflict throughout the whole period until
1789. Henceforth, however, the regulation of the
trade, the establishment of a responsible organization,
and the fixing of regulations between masters and men
changed the field of strife. We hear little or nothing
more of strikes. The state was recognized as the
source of regulation and as the arbiter of questions
which might arise between the associated employers
on one hand and their partially associated employees
on the other. The industrial struggles hereafter took
the form of litigation rather than of strikes. The
outlaw industry at last obtained a recognized, responsible
position in the industrial world.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Community of Printers</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>An unregulated trade, conducted under conditions
of absolute freedom approximating those of the
present day, was not only out of place in the Middle
Ages but was practically impossible. We have seen
how the attempt to carry on a trade under such conditions
resulted in a state of intolerable confusion in
the printing industry. Accordingly a royal edict was
issued by King Louis XII supplying the needed regulations
for the conduct of the industry according to
seventeenth century ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as the industry itself was concerned the important
feature of this edict was the organization of the
Community of Printers. This Community embraced
all the printing trades; that is to say, printing, book
binding, type founding, and bookselling. The master
workmen carrying on shops in any of these allied
industries were members of the Community. It differed
from the trade guilds in that it was an organization
of employers only. It did not include even the
master workmen who were not employers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain matters were decided upon by the Community
as a whole, but the work of the Community
was carried on for the most part by a sort of Executive
Committee called the Syndics. This Committee consisted
of a chairman, who is usually referred to as the
Syndic, and four associates or assessors. This board
was chosen annually. Originally the elections were
held in general assemblages of the industry at which
all members of the Community were entitled to vote.
Later the elections were in the hands of a board consisting
of the five syndics for the year, past members
of the board of syndics, and twenty-four electors. Of
these twenty-four, eight were printers, eight booksellers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and eight binders. The type founders appear never to
have been very important members of the Community
and probably soon ceased to be represented among the
syndics. At the time the Community was organized
typefounding was not a separate industry, but was
carried on by the printers themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duty of the syndics was to act as the corporate
representatives of the industry. They fixed wages and
prices. They adjusted disputes between their fellow-members
and acted for the employers in dealing with
the employees. They had powers of visitation and supervision.
Through these they were supposed to exercise
a sort of censorship over printing, to maintain the
quality of work done, to see that trade regulations were
enforced and trade agreements carried out; in a word, to
exercise the same minute control over the industry
which was exercised by the guilds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new organization was a very great improvement
over the former lack of organization, but it was very
far from being completely successful. Its first effort
was to regulate admission to mastership and so to
membership of the Community. The number of shops
in Paris in 1618 was 76. By 1686 this number had
been reduced to 36 and the process was still going on.
At Troyes in 1700 there were 16 shops and in 1739
only 3. This limitation was brought about by freezing
out the small shops, by strict regulation of admissions
to the Community without which the business could
not be legally carried on, and by the purchase from
time to time of certificates of membership. A certificate
of membership in the Community was a very
considerable asset to an individual and on his death
it passed to his heirs. While it could not apparently
be sold outside the family, it had distinct value and
could often be purchased and cancelled by the Community.
Except by inheritances membership might be
obtained only through advancement in the trade from
apprenticeship through journeymanship to master
workmanship, as we shall see later. The fees required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>for membership of the Community and the capital
required for carrying on business were so great that
very few attained membership of the Community in
this way. Membership of the Community, however,
was open to the sons of members or to those who
might marry the widows of members, and in a very
short time membership became practically limited
to those who obtained it in one or the other of these
ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Community was undoubtedly very useful in
giving a corporate center to the industry and also in
giving more support to trade usages, contracts, and
agreements. On the other hand its efficiency was
greatly weakened by the quarrels which immediately
broke out between the three elements of the Community
and which lasted until the final break-up of the old
conditions in 1789. The quarrel was mainly between
the printers and the booksellers or publishers. The
binders were soon recognized as forming an independent
industry and they were before very long eliminated
from the Community of Printers. They formed a
Community of their own in 1686 and need not be
further considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hostility between the booksellers and the printers
began with the invention of printing. Their interests
were so closely related and yet so antagonistic that an
attempt to combine them in one Community while at
the same time keeping their functions separate resulted
in constant quarrels and in a weakening of the influence
of the Community itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The booksellers, for instance, were lax in their
supervision and control in matters where the printers
were directly concerned, while the printers were equally
negligent of the interests of the booksellers. The
printers naturally desired to restrict the number of
printers but they were glad to see the number of booksellers
competing for the privilege of handling their
output increased indefinitely. The booksellers, being
fewer in number and probably richer, were more united
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>and more aggressive than the printers. They attempted
to get control of manuscripts so that the
printers could not produce anything without first
paying toll to the owners of the manuscripts. We
must always remember that at this period the great
mass of commercial and periodical printing which
supports the industry today was not in existence, and
that printing was practically confined to books and
official documents. The booksellers also wanted to
print for themselves; that is to say, to hire journeymen
printers and so make themselves independent of the
master printers. By their resistence to the closing of
the mastership and by the cultivation of competition
they did their best to lower the prices of printing. In
a word, they endeavored to subjugate the printers
entirely. In this they did not succeed, but they kept
the quarrel alive, very much to the detriment of the
industry, until the end of the old industrial order.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>How The Old-time Printers Worked</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Before considering the organization of a shop
and the conditions under which the work was
done, it is worth while to look into a printing establishment
of the sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth century
and see how the work itself was carried on. This
general view of an old-time printing plant will be made
fairly full even at the cost of some repetition of facts
already stated elsewhere on account of the importance
of presenting here as complete a picture as possible of
the life and labor of printers in the centuries under
discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Originally the printer did everything except to make
his paper and his presses. He designed and cast
his type, he made his ink, he edited his manuscript,
printed his books, bound them, and, for a time, sold
them. We have just considered his relations to the
bookseller. He got rid of his type casting about one
hundred years after the invention. The type foundry
of Guillaume Le Bé, established about 1551, seems to
have been the beginning of type founding as a separate
industry, although in later years some very large
establishments maintained type foundries and even
paper mills as incidents of the business; but the
printer from this time on began to get his type outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bookbinding came to be regarded as a separate
industry at about the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ink making was done by the printer until comparatively
recently. The ink balls which were used for
distributing the ink on types were made by the printers
themselves until the ink ball was superseded by the roller
with the coming in of modern presses. Even then
rollers were made in the shops for a long time, and
indeed the practice is hardly now entirely discontinued.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The early paper was hand-made and was thick, with
a rough, furrowed surface. It was grayish or yellowish
in color and was very strongly water-marked. It was
very costly, but very durable. It was heavy and hard
to handle, especially as it was handled without mechanical
appliances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early types were irregular in face and body as
the natural result of being cast in hand moulds from
hand cut dies. The early types were cast on large
bodies and were used without leads. The point
system, which reduced type to uniformity and did
away with the annoying irregularity in size of the old
types, did not come into existence until the middle of
the eighteenth century, three hundred years after
the invention of printing. Of course, all composition
throughout this period was done by hand. Women
were employed as compositors as early as 1500, but
they apparently disappeared from the industry before
long, as we find no evidence of their presence after
the reorganization of 1618 or for some time before that.</p>

<p class='c007'>The press was substantially the old screw press of
Gutenberg in which the platen was forced down onto
the bed by the direct pressure of a screw. A few improvements
had been made. A sliding bed was introduced
in 1500. A copper screw (more effective and
durable than the old wooden screw), tympan, and frisket
were added in 1550, and the so-called Dutch press,
which did away with the necessity of raising the platen
by a reverse motion of the screw by substituting
leverage for it, was introduced in 1620. These were
the only improvements of any note which were made
before the introduction of the Stanhope press about 1800.
Of course, the presses were worked by hand power and
it will be seen that the setting up of the screw or the
throwing of a lever with sufficient force to insure a good
impression was an extremely laborious task. It was
sometimes dangerous, as the screw bar or lever was
liable to break when the workman’s weight and strength
were thrown upon it, resulting in serious injuries.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The ink was good—well-aged linseed oil, boiled until
viscous when cool, and mixed in a mortar with resin
black. It was mixed in the proportion of thirty-two
ounces of oil to five ounces of black. Of course, it was
variable, its quality depending upon the quality of the
ingredients and the care exercised in preparation.
It was spread on the type by means of balls of leather
stuffed with wool and firmly attached to wooden
handles. One of these balls was taken in each hand,
a small portion of ink was spread evenly over the balls
by rubbing them together, and the ink ball was then
passed over the type so as to distribute the ink as
evenly as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Composition was done by the full page. This was a
fairly reasonable method of reckoning, as the kinds of
printing were not varied as they are now. Compositors
worked “on honor” and were paid by time. Payment
by ems is a very late advance, not having been adopted
until about 1775.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imposition was done practically as now.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pressman’s day began by the preparation,
through softening and cleaning, of the balls which were
to be used on the day’s run, and the mixing of the
amount of ink considered necessary for the day’s work.
Make-ready, adjustment of margins, register, and the
like had to be attended to before the impressions could
be taken. Meanwhile the paper had been dampened.
The old screw press could not print on dry paper.
Paper came from the mill in “hands” or packages of
twenty-five sheets, folded once and laid inside each
other as note paper is now sold by the stationer.
A “hand” was dipped in a tub of water. It was then
taken out and the sheets were placed flat under weights
to squeeze out the superfluous water and keep the
sheets in shape. After the water had been squeezed
out the sheets were re-folded into “hands” and sent
to the pressroom to be placed upon the press while
still damp.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Two men worked together on the press, one inking
the type and the other making the impression. They
worked turn and turn about in hour shifts so that the
more and less laborious work was equally distributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two-color work was done by taking two impressions
from one form. The parts which were intended to be
printed in red were set in higher type than the rest
and a perforated frisket was used. The red ink impression
was taken first. The type for red ink was then
removed and slugs were put in, making the form type
high throughout. From this form the impression was
taken in black ink. As might be supposed, the register
was almost always imperfect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The printed leaves while still damp were piled under
weights to remove the counter impression of the type
which naturally struck through the damp paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The printing was done with the paper sufficiently
damp to make this simple process of removal fairly
successful. Later the printed sheets were pressed
between heated plates of metal, giving a very smooth
and glossy surface to the page.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pressman was paid by time like the compositor,
but he was expected to accomplish a given amount of
work in a day. In Paris, about 1575, he was expected
to print 2650 sheets, while at Lyons the day’s work was
held to be 3350. All folding, of course, was done by
hand with no further assistance than that of the bone
or wooden folding stick. The first sheet from the
press was taken as a sample or proof. Proving, as
distinguished from printing, was then unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Proofreading was done practically as now and the
proof marks were substantially the same. Two corrections
per page must be made by the compositor
without extra compensation. Other corrections were
apparently not made by the original compositor, but
by other workmen who were employed as piece workers
on that particular occupation for the time being. The
printer appears to have ordinarily managed to get these
corrections charged to the author.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>There was a rude system of cost finding and estimating
in force. In making a price on a job the
printer charged first for the paper. Whether or not he
took a profit here is uncertain, but he probably did
when he thought he could get it. The paper did not
enter any further into his computation. He next estimated
the cost of the labor. He then figured 50 per
cent of the labor cost as overhead, including such
minor items as ink and other special materials which
might be needed on that particular job before it got
to the customer. He then added another 25 per cent
of the labor cost, which was supposed to be profit, and
upon that basis he made up his price. Presumably there
were price cutters and more or less unsuccessful guessers
in those days as there are now, but the method just
outlined was supposed to be that by which printers
generally reached their figures. The financial success
of the printer depended, of course, on operation. He
might so conduct his work that the 50 per cent overhead
might leave a considerable margin to be added
to the 25 per cent profit or, on the other hand, he might
so bungle it as to eat up the 25 per cent and more too.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Internal Organization of the Industry</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The workers in the industry were divided into
four clearly defined classes, namely apprentices,
laborers, journeymen, and masters. In this, as in most
respects in this volume, the study is based largely on
conditions prevailing in France for the reason that we
have much more abundant material from French sources
than elsewhere. The conditions in France, however,
were probably substantially the same as those which
existed elsewhere, so that by studying conditions in
France we get a very fair idea of those which generally
prevailed at this period.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Apprentices</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The apprentices, as now, were the boys and young
men learning the industry under an apprenticeship
agreement. The age of apprentices varied considerably.
They were not often received under seventeen or above
twenty-four. Perhaps the majority of them were
received at the age of nineteen or twenty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The printer’s apprentice was probably a little older
as a rule than the apprentice in other industries because
he had to have a much more extensive previous education.
It was not only necessary that he should be
well versed in his own language and in the essentials of
ordinary education, but it was necessary that he should
also be able to read and write both Latin and Greek.
While it is true that after a few years many books were
printed in the native tongue of the printers, it must not
be forgotten that the printing of this period was almost
entirely book printing and to a very great extent the
printing of books of what we should call today religion
and serious literature. Latin was the universal language
of the Catholic Church as it is today. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>also the language of learned men everywhere. No
scholar thought of writing a serious work in English,
French, or German. He might translate one into the
vernacular or he might, especially after the beginning of
the religious controversies, write a controversial book
in his native language, but for the most part serious
writing was done in Latin. There was a considerable
amount of printing of Greek classics in the original,
although there was not much use of Greek for original
composition. Under these circumstances it is clear
that the knowledge of these tongues was very important.
The enforcement, however, of the strict requirements
of this period was a cause of many disputes in the
industry. The employers then as now were ready to
hire cheap help for cheap jobs, and they were given to
taking on apprentices far beyond the requirements of
recruiting the industry because they could get a good
deal of work out of them which otherwise must be
given to higher priced men. In many cases they were
willing to take on apprentices who did not understand
Greek or even Latin. The result was injury to the
industry itself and to the interests of the workmen, as
is always the case when employers take on improperly
trained apprentices who are incapable of development
into the highest efficiency. We shall meet these half-trained
apprentices a little later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further requirements were that the apprentice should
be of good life and manners and that he should be a
Catholic and a native of France and unmarried.</p>

<p class='c007'>An apprenticeship agreement was a formal contract.
Originally this was a verbal contract only, a sort of
“gentlemen’s agreement.” After the reorganization
of 1618 it was a written contract drawn up by a notary.
The period of apprenticeship varied somewhat, especially
before 1618. In general, however, it was four
years. The condition of the contract was that the
apprentice should pay a specified sum to the master
for the privilege of learning the trade and that he
should agree to serve his master with care and diligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>for a period of four years and not neglect his master’s
interests nor spoil his master’s goods. In return the
master was bound to teach him the trade of printing so
that at the end of his time he would be qualified as a
journeyman. In addition the master was bound to furnish
the apprentice lodging, food, clothing in specified
quantity, and sometimes a very small amount of money.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apprentice lived in the master’s house and ate
either at the master’s table or at the table set for the
journeymen, who also received their food from the
master. If the apprentice absented himself for any
reason from his work his absence must be atoned for
by double time added to the period of apprenticeship.
If his absences were repeated he was liable to be discharged.
In this case the master was held to be the
sufferer, the contract of apprenticeship was cancelled,
and the entire amount paid in by the apprentice as a
premium was forfeited to the master. It frequently
happened that apprentices desired to be relieved of their
contracts before the expiration of their time. Sometimes
it happened that they changed their minds about
becoming printers, more often, probably, they sought
short cuts into the industry. It has always been the
misfortune of printing that a very imperfect knowledge
of it has a comparatively higher market value than an
equally imperfect knowledge of other industries, while
the period of apprenticeship required for full learning
of the trade is long and wearisome. The apprentices
were often tempted by offers of occupation as laborers
or even as journeymen in some of the poorer shops
which were willing to evade regulations. The habit of
canceling indentures before their expiration for a
money consideration thus grew up to the serious detriment
of the industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The printers made profit by taking the premium from
the apprentice and then selling him his freedom before
his indenture had expired. The injury to the industry
and to the well-trained workman of this competition
of half-trained, incompetent workmen is perfectly clear.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The masters, of course, complained that the apprentices
were idle, wasteful, and unteachable, and probably
some of them were. Boys and young men were good,
bad, and indifferent in the Middle Ages just as they
are now. The apprentices complained on the other
hand that they were overworked, underfed, and
personally abused in many instances. Doubtless these
complaints were often well founded because grownup
men were good, bad, and indifferent in the Middle
Ages very much as they are now.</p>

<p class='c007'>At best the work of the apprentice was very hard.
Living as he did in the master’s house and working
in the shop as a beginner, he was a cross between a
domestic servant, an errand boy, and a learner in
the industry. The master’s wife might call upon him
to wash the kitchen floor. The foreman might send
him out with a package of proofs. The workmen
might send him out for a bottle of wine or a pot of beer,
or he might be set to work on one of the legitimate
tasks of his apprenticeship only to be called away at
almost any time by some such personal demand as
those just indicated. His hours, like those of everybody
else in the trade, were very long. He was expected
to keep the shop clean and in order, to clean
the type and the presses, to mix ink, to dampen paper,
and if he were strong and well grown he might even be
put to working on the press. These and a thousand
other things, many of them unknown to modern shops,
were required of him besides the work at the case and
elsewhere which gave him his real knowledge of the trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of the number of apprentices was a
burning one. Previous to 1618 it was one of the great
causes of strikes and labor disputes. The masters
at that time desired to increase the number of apprentices
indefinitely, to which the journeymen objected
on account of the injury to their interests by
having too many workmen, especially cheap ones.
The journeymen succeeded in securing a royal edict
which limited the number of apprentices to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>employed in any establishment to two for each press,
one on composition and the other on presswork. The
shop conditions which have been already described
show that this taking of the press as a unit was fairly
equitable. In the absence of machine work both
composition and presswork were slow, and had a more
nearly equal rate of speed than now. After 1618 the
masters attempted to enforce the limitation of apprentices
as against each other. They feared the
competition of the man who succeeded in getting into
his shop a supply of cheap help which enabled him to
cut prices, consequently the journeymen no longer
appear as parties to this dispute.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the whole period there were complaints that
the apprenticeship regulations were not enforced and
that some of the masters insisted upon taking more
than the proper number of apprentices and taking
them with less than the proper qualifications. This
seems to have been a very real difficulty and one which
was never entirely overcome. The temptation to
obtain cheap labor, regardless of the welfare of either
the apprentice or the industry, was too great, and many
printers found it impossible to resist it, especially as
during the latter part of this period the conditions in
the industry became very bad and it was almost impossible
to make any money at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout this period, especially after 1618, all
regulations as to apprenticeship were relaxed in favor
of the sons of masters and other persons whom the
masters desired particularly to favor. One of the most
significant and far-reaching of the regulations of the
printing trade was that which admitted the sons of
masters directly to membership without any previous
training. We shall discuss this a little more fully later.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Laborers</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The class of workmen called laborers constituted a
source of one of the greatest difficulties and abuses in
the industry, especially during the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>At this period there were no restrictions on their
employment, or at least none that were successfully
enforced. After that period they were less freely
employed. They were ignorant or unskilled workmen
incapable of becoming journeymen. It was into this
class that the apprentices dropped who were employed
without sufficient previous education, more especially
those who were ignorant in Greek and Latin. The
class was further made up of apprentices who had not
finished their time, workmen who proved incompetent
to hold journeymen’s positions, and men who could do
rough work but had never been apprentices. Obviously
there was a good deal of work which these men could
do. Part of it was work which would otherwise be
done by apprentices, part work which would otherwise
be done by journeymen. The unrestricted hiring of
these men limited the number of journeymen’s positions,
reduced wages, lowered standards, and was in
every way detrimental to the industry.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Journeymen</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>In the printing industry the journeyman was not
the same as the master. In other industries after the
apprentice had finished his time and qualified by submitting
a piece of work of approved standard, he
became a master workman. He was made free of the
guild and ordinarily set up in business for himself.
Theoretically a somewhat similar condition prevailed
in the printing trade. Before the reorganization of
1618 and the consequent restriction of mastership the
apprentice became a master workman when he had
completed his time, and was at liberty to set up for
himself if he so desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the reorganization the apprentice after having
finished his time became a journeyman in the shop to
which he had been apprenticed. Originally he was
restricted to that shop. He was then required to serve
as a journeyman from two to four years. At the expiration
of that period he passed a theoretical and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>practical examination. This covered his proficiency
in the languages and other academic subjects required
and the submission of a piece of completed work. He
was also obliged to submit a certificate of character
covering the requirements of apprenticeship and testifying
as to his conduct while an apprentice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of his admission to the Community
was then voted upon by the syndics, and if he was
found qualified and admitted he was formally received
into the Community at a public meeting at which were
present the syndics and the elders of the Community.
He was then sworn in as a member of the Community
by the Lieutenant-General of Police. Before being
sworn in, however, he was required to pay certain fees.
Originally these fees were small, but they afterward
became very large.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, very few journeymen became
masters. The heavy fees in themselves were almost
prohibitive, but the greatest obstacle was the difficulty
about raising the necessary capital. No other business
at that time required so heavy an outlay for equipment,
material, and labor before any return whatever could
be realized. The equipment was very expensive and
there were no small jobs such as are found in modern
commercial offices, especially those of the less pretentious
type, to keep the plant going. The printer
was obliged to go to the entire expense for material
and labor involved in getting out an edition of a book
before he could begin to get any returns from it. Sometimes
he knew where he could sell the book (Caxton
seems to have been particularly successful in this
regard), but more often he did not know. There is in
existence a letter written by Sweynheym and Pannartz
to the Pope asking him for assistance. They set forth
their case by saying that they have sunk a great deal
of money in procuring equipment and printing books
which have sold slowly. They complain that they
have a large house full of books but with nothing in it
to eat, and beg that he will either assist them in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>sale of their books or tide them over until they can
find a market.</p>

<p class='c007'>These conditions tended to keep the journeymen
permanently in that position and to confine the masters
to those who came into the business by inheritance or
marriage. The printing industry has thus the unfortunate
prominence of being the leading influence in
breaking up the old unities of industry and bringing
about the modern industrial system. It was the first
industry in which there was developed a distinct class
of masters who were not and never had been workmen,
and in which the workman could become a master
only under unusual circumstances. The sharp division
of industry into employers and employed with antagonistic
interests and divergent aims begins here.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hours of labor in the printing industry were very
long. Throughout France they averaged about fourteen
hours a day, and similar conditions appear to have
prevailed elsewhere. As already indicated, a certain
amount of product, particularly on the press, was
considered to be a fair day’s work. In 1572 the 3350
sheets per day required of a pressman at Lyons compelled
him to work from two o’clock in the morning
to eight or nine in the evening without leaving the shop.
This appears from evidence submitted in litigation.
Printers were boarded and generally lodged by their
employers. Plantin’s establishment, still in existence
in Amsterdam, shows living quarters for all of the
workmen who were employed in the plant. They
were given their meals in the shop and were permitted
to send the apprentices out for wine or beer, which they
drank in considerable quantities. The men themselves
objected to going out for their food, although they
often complained of the quality of that furnished.
Their objection was based upon the fact that they so
depended upon each other for their work that if men
went out, especially if they overstayed their time, they
would be likely to hold up each other’s work and make
it impossible to complete the required task of the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>even in the very liberal time allowance which was then
regarded as reasonable.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not to be wondered at that the long hours, close
confinement, and hard work encouraged the drinking
habits which were proverbial among printers. The
natural result of so much drinking was a good deal of
disorder and violence, especially on holidays. There
is no reason to suppose, however, that printers as a
class were worse than other workmen of their day and
generation. They were much superior in education
and they were recognized as being of higher social
condition. They were exempt from many of the legal
requirements upon journeymen in other trades, and
their industry was more than once recognized by
royal edict as being an art or profession and not a
mechanical trade. The printers were very proud of
this social distinction and, as has been already stated,
emphasized their claim to it by wearing swords, which
in those days was the mark of the gentleman or
professional man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hard work and long hours had two compensations;
one partial, the other very real. The first, which
printing shared with other industries, was the great
number of holidays. The shops did not work on
Sundays or feast days. Under modern conditions
there are slightly more than 300 working days in the
year, taking out Sundays and holidays and making no
allowance for illness or voluntary absence. In the
period with which we are dealing there were only from
230 to 240 working days in the year; that is to say,
there were 60 or 70 more holidays than we now have.
Probably shorter hours and more days of work would
have been better for all concerned. The other compensation
was the very high rate of wages. To state the
printer’s wages of that time in terms of money would
carry very little information, partly because of the
difference in coinage and partly because of the difference
in the purchasing power of money. The really enlightening
fact is that the wages of a printer were from two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>to three times those of journeymen in the other skilled
trades. Actual wages were fixed by the operation of
the law of supply and demand and by the skill of the
individual workman. There was what we should call
today a “scale” fixed either by custom or by law.
The scale, however, instead of being a minimum, as
now, was a maximum, the variations being below
instead of above it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately there was a great deal of unemployment,
owing to the prevalence of a form of work which
will be presently described. This unemployment was
not only a serious evil in itself, but it led to competition
among workmen, who were often willing to work for
less than the going rate rather than to go idle. Another
tendency toward the lowering of wages was the competition
in the book trade caused by literary piracy and
the work of printers from the smaller towns or even
outside countries who could do work cheaper than it
could be done in the larger cities. For example, in the
absence of copyright a printer might go to the expense
of getting out an edition of an important work only to
have a rival buy one of his copies and throw into the
market an edition at a price based on the cost of
manufacture only, while it is obvious that even if the
competition were based on the cost of manufacture
the printer from Lyons could undersell the printer
from Paris because his presses turned out 700 more
sheets a day, an advantage of 25 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this competition had a tendency to reduce selling
prices and to drive down the workman’s pay. It was
for these reasons that the employers were so anxious
to use laborers instead of journeymen, and apprentices
instead of either. All these depressing tendencies had full
sway under the curiously inverted scale system which
made the scale a maximum instead of a minimum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Journeymen were divided into two classes, day
workers and piece workers. The day worker was
engaged under an annual contract which covered his
salary, his board, and usually his lodging. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>printing trade these contracts were written after 1618.
In the other industries they were not written, although
verbal contracts were common to all industries.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases these bargains were collective; that is
to say, they were made between the Community and
the journeymen’s organization soon to be described.
Wherever possible, however, the masters prevented the
organization of the journeymen and compelled the men
to resort to individual bargaining.</p>

<p class='c007'>The piece workers were men who were engaged for
some particular contract or job which the master had
in hand. Whenever an important piece of work was
undertaken a number of extra men, depending upon
the equipment and the time in which it was desired to
do the job, were employed. Day workers and men
employed for another job were supposed not to be
put on and no additional men were to be employed for
it, unless some of the original group dropped out. The
men were supposed to know how long the job would
last and were supposed not to be discharged without
eight days’ notice. These men were paid by the day
and were fed and sometimes lodged like the day workmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The workmen constantly complained that in practice
they were greatly abused under this system. They
claimed that they were discharged without notice, that
day men were put to work on their jobs, and that additional
men were hired, shortening the period of their
occupation. This manipulation of the job was a
frequent device of the masters in order to finish a
piece of work before a holiday, especially when a
Sunday and a holiday and even two holidays came
together, as was not infrequently the case with the
great number of holidays then observed. By hurrying
up the job and finishing it before the holiday the
master could avoid feeding the men over the holiday.
Under ordinary circumstances he was supposed to
feed his men, whether day workers or piece workers,
throughout the period of their employment, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>or not he paid them on holidays. The result of this
system was that a very large proportion, probably a
large majority, of the printers had no regular employment,
working only at such job work as they could from
time to time pick up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The journeymen were graded as first- and second-class
workmen and foremen. The first-class workman
was a sort of assistant foreman. He was employed
upon the more difficult work or aided the foreman in
the discharge of his duties. The second-class was the
ordinary workman, comparable today to a man who
would be earning the union scale with very little
prospect of ever getting any more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two departments of composition and presswork
were recognized then as now. Just as at present, there
was keen rivalry between compositors and pressmen,
each claiming that his was the superior art and required
the greater skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the composing room there were three subdivisions—compositors,
stone-hands and make-up men, and distributors.
These last appear to have been employed on
that particular work exclusively. There were no divisions
in the press room. As has been pointed out,
two men were employed on the press, one on the ink
balls and the other on the lever, but these were not
separate occupations as the two men exchanged positions
every hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foreman was a man capable of oversight of all
processes carried on in the plant. The foremanship
was not divided as it now is between the foreman of
the composing room and the foreman of the press room.
These functions were discharged by first-class workmen
under the supervision of the foreman. The foreman
was also a proofreader, at least in part. He corrected
the first proofs although they were afterwards corrected
by the author and sometimes by the master or an
editor in his employ. It was necessary, therefore, that
the foreman should be not only a first-class workman
but an accomplished scholar. He had to be thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>versed in his own language and highly trained in Latin
and Greek or any other language in which books were
printed in the plant. He was obliged also to be thoroughly
familiar with theological, philosophical, or
scientific terms, or any other special terms required
for any particular kind of printing which the plant
undertook.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the workman became too old and infirm to
hold his place or his eyesight failed there were several
sources of at least partial support open to him if his
family was not in a condition to support him. Some
of these old workmen were licensed by the syndics of
the Community to peddle tracts, almanacs, broadside
sheets of ballads and notices, and other things which
might be called the small wares of the printing trade.
Some of them did a sort of junk business in old paper
and parchments. In some places there were asylums
for aged printers where a few found entrance. Others
became pensioners on the Community. The Community
in France and similar organizations elsewhere
appear to have had funds especially for this purpose
and to have used some of their current funds for charity.
Other old men were allowed to make the rounds of the
shops, particularly those in which they had been employed,
taking a few coppers from their younger and
more fortunate fellow workmen. There seems to have
been a sort of comradeship among the printers which
made these old fellows welcome as they made their
periodical rounds for help.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>The Master</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The master has perhaps been sufficiently described
as we went along. He was the capitalist who carried
on the business. In the great days of Jenson and
Aldus and the Estiennes he was often, himself, his
own foreman and best journeyman. We have seen,
however, how he gradually came to be in many cases a
business man with little or no practical knowledge of
the business.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>In the early days of printing the masters seem to
have been more prosperous than they were later.
Godart and Merlin, of Paris, in 1538 employed 200 men.
Such printers as these were rich and prosperous and
held in high esteem by their fellow citizens. We have
seen, however, that some of the greatest of the printers
were constantly struggling with financial difficulties.
The reorganization of 1618 did not seem to have the
effect upon the prosperity of the masters which might
have been expected. As we have seen, there was a
cut-throat competition and even after the reorganization
of the Community and the restrictions of mastership
governmental control had a tendency to grow
more and more burdensome while the market for their
wares increased but slowly. It is said that in 1700
there were not two printers in Paris who were worth
25,000 francs or $5000. In 1700, $5000 was worth two
or three times that amount now, but even so the fact
stated shows the prostration of the industry.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Relations Between Employer and Employed</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The printing industry has always been liable to
friction between the employers and the employed.
We have already made reference from time to time to
strikes and labor disputes, going back to the very
beginnings of the industry. Previous to the reorganization
of 1618 the workmen generally had recourse to
strikes for the settlement of disputes and the masters
in turn appealed to the civil authorities. In conformity
with the ideas of those days the authorities
intervened, if at all, to suppress the strike. The idea
of authority was very strong at that period and rebellion
or disobedience on the part of laborers was regarded
as little less than sedition or treason. Social lines were
sharply drawn and every attempt possible was made to
secure and maintain the supremacy of those in authority,
whether that authority were civil, ecclesiastical,
or industrial.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the reorganization of 1618, however, the
strike as a means of settlement was rarely resorted to
until revived in modern times. The very organization
of the industry made it amenable to authority and
made it possible to settle disputes by legal processes.
Accordingly, we find that both masters and journeymen
presented their cases before the courts or the executive
officers having authority and endeavored to gain their
points by means of laws or edicts. The journeymen on
the whole were more successful by this method than
they had previously been, although the points of
dispute were never permanently settled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization of the Community united the
masters, but the attempts of the journeymen to unite
were met with constant opposition and were frequently
prohibited by law. The germ of the journeymen’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>organization was the chapel. Originally the chapel
was a group of workmen engaged on the same job and
consequently dependent upon each other for its success
and for the regular progress of the work. The origin
of the name is somewhat in doubt, but it probably is
either derived from the fact that many of the early
printing establishments were connected with monasteries,
or under the patronage of the church, or from
the fact that the printers were educated men, and in
the 15th century educated men were generally identified
with the clergy. In English law, until within a
comparatively recent time, a man convicted of certain
crimes could escape capital punishment if he could
prove that he could read and write. This proof was held
to identify him with the clergy, who were exempted from
certain criminal provisions of the statutes. This process
was technically known as “pleading one’s clergy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The chapel was soon extended to include in its
membership all the workmen in one shop, and in this
significance the name is still in use. The organization
of journeymen into chapels runs back to the early days
of printing. There never seems to have been any
serious attempt to prevent this organization in individual
shops for the reason that such an organization
was highly beneficial to the masters themselves,
securing the better co-ordination of related processes
and hence more efficient production. In France the
chapel was legally recognized in 1777, only a short time
before the break-up of the old order. The chapel had
certain revenues which were derived from assessments
and fees which it laid upon its members and particularly
from the sale of books. It was the custom to give
to the chapel a certain number of copies of every book
printed. These revenues appear to have been intended
originally as provision for certain periodical feasts and
festivals such as were common in all the guilds of the
middle ages. Later they were extended to cover
charity and also to provide a sort of war chest out of
which the expense of litigation could be met.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The combination of these chapels or the formation
of tacit understandings between them created a sort
of trade union, and the combination of their funds made
possible the raising of the large amounts of money
necessary to employ counsel and carry on the litigations
against the employers. The employers, often backed
by the authorities, strove throughout this period to
prevent these combinations. They understood fully
the tactical value of the precept “divide and rule,” and
they did their best to keep the journeymen divided and
at the same time to strengthen the bonds of their own
union. In this, however, they were only partially
successful. In spite of edicts to the contrary, the
chapels, though unable to form an open, strong organization
which could meet the Community on equal
terms or to act with the openness and authority of the
modern trade union, nevertheless maintained a very
real and often effective organization through correspondence,
conferences, and other methods of securing
mutual agreement and common action.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the general settlements of industrial
conditions which were sought by legislation, individual
disputes in particular shops or localities were often
settled by arbitration. The great difficulty about these
arbitrations, which rendered their results unsatisfactory
and was never obviated during this whole
period, arose from the impossibility of agreeing on a
satisfactory board of arbitrators. The masters insisted
that all these arbitrations should be referred either to
the courts or to the syndics. To this the journeymen
seriously objected. They felt that the courts would
not really arbitrate but would settle the matter by an
application of the statutes, and they knew by experience
that the statutes were generally construed against
the journeymen wherever possible. They were on the
whole very law-abiding people. They had no disposition
to break the statutes, but the questions which
they wanted decided were either as to the application
of the statutes or as to points not covered by them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>On the other hand they felt that the syndics were
entirely unqualified to act as arbitrators for the reason
that they were masters and consequently interested
parties. The masters were insistent whenever possible
that these cases should go to the syndics, although as
an alternative they were willing that they should go to
the courts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The journeymen desired that arbitration boards
should be composed of masters, workmen, and citizens
not connected with the industry. They maintained
that only thus could the interests of all be fairly represented
and an impartial arbitration secured. To
this type of board the masters almost invariably objected,
and they generally refused to submit to its findings.
In this regard the journeymen appear to much
better advantage than the masters throughout this
period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main points of dispute have already been indicated
and were on the whole not different from
similar difficulties today.</p>

<p class='c007'>First and foremost came the question of pay and
food, usually together. Occasionally men were satisfied
with their food but not with their pay or vice versa,
but ordinarily the two went together. The man who
paid badly was likely to feed badly. Another burning
question was the right of combination on the part of
the journeymen or, as we should say today, the question
of the recognition of the union. Another point was the
matter of discharge or leaving without notice. The
grievance arising from discharge without notice has
already been discussed. The masters complained that
the men would leave without notice and so render it
impossible for them to complete their jobs according
to contract. This was one of the evils attendant on the
piece system which has already been described. On
the one hand the masters tried to manipulate it by
hiring extra men and the like so as to increase their
profits, while on the other hand workmen facing the
danger of a period of unemployment would leave a job
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>unfinished if they could get employment on another
job which promised several weeks or even months of
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another fruitful cause of difference was tickets of
leave or cards of dismissal. When a man left a job he
was supposed to be given a card which identified him,
told where he had been employed, what he did there,
how well he did it, and what his conduct had been in
the shop. He was supposed to show this card before
obtaining employment. The workmen complained
that these cards were withheld or improperly filled
out for personal or other unworthy reasons. Sometimes
masters were very particular about giving and
demanding these cards. At other times they were
very lax in both these regards and the consequence
was that the card system was a source of constant
annoyance to all concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint was also made by journeymen that
members of the Community maintained a black-list,
and if a journeyman offended a single member of the
Community or fell into disfavor in a single shop he
might be placed on this black-list and find it impossible
to obtain employment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, there were many other questions which
arose from time to time but these were the particular
causes of difficulty which we find constantly recurring,
just as the questions of pay, hours, recognition of the
union, and handling of non-union material constantly
recur today.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fairly careful study of the conditions of this period
shows that according to our modern ideas the journeymen
generally appear to better advantage than the
masters. There is no question, of course, that there
were unreasonable demands and that individual journeymen
or even groups of journeymen behaved at
times in objectionable ways. On the whole, however,
the effort of the journeymen of this period seems to
have been only to obtain fair treatment and a reasonable
recognition of their rights. They especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>desired to be treated as men and to confer on equal
terms with their employers instead of being treated as
inferior beings bound to accept without protest what
was handed down to them. It must be remembered
that they were far more highly educated than the
workers in any other industry and that they had been
officially recognized many times as being in a class
apart from the ordinary workmen. They appear to
have attempted only to secure in the industry the
same recognition which they legally enjoyed socially.
While they did attempt to have a voice in the fixing
of wages and hours there is very little evidence of any
attempt to enforce upon the shops the observance of
rules and regulations made by themselves. The
masters on the other hand had those ancient ideas of
authority which have already been mentioned. They
were not willing that their employees should rise above
the level of other workers and they were not willing
to recognize them as men entitled to fair consideration,
to say nothing of equal rights. They lived in the days
of serfdom and they took their position as masters
quite seriously and quite literally. This opposition in
spirit between the masters who, by their wealth, their
education, and their social position were associated
with the upper classes and imbued with all of their
ancient pride, and the men who, themselves educated
and imbued with a spirit of progress and a desire for
freedom, were attempting to rise above the condition
of serfdom in which the laborers of that age were
commonly held was the real root of the struggles in
the medieval printing trade. The purely industrial
questions involved were the occasions rather than the
causes of strife.</p>

<p class='c007'>The end of the old regime is marked in France by the
date 1789. This date marks the beginning of the
French Revolution when great masses of medieval
statutes were swept from the statute books, including
all those which regulated the trade of printing. The
Community, censorship, licenses to print, and all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>edicts regulating conditions in the industry went by
the board together. The French Revolution, however,
was only an incident of a change which was coming
over the thinking of the whole world. A new condition
had been growing up under the old forms and the
time had come when the old forms had to break to
make way for the new life. They broke in the most
dramatic and tragic fashion in France and therefore
we think and speak of this event as the French Revolution,
but the change took place elsewhere in as real
though a less striking manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the features of this change was the birth of
the newspaper and an enormous production of pamphlets
and other minor literature. There had been
newspapers and periodicals for a long time before, but
the ferment of men’s minds which began in the middle
of the eighteenth century naturally caused a great production
of printed matter and a demand that it should
be produced very quickly. Much of this printed matter
was of a sort forbidden by the old laws and regulations.
The greater part of it, being produced under conditions
of haste inconsistent with good workmanship and under
a demand for cheapness also inconsistent with good
workmanship, was of a very poor quality. The industry
was disordered by a great increase in the
number of shops, particularly shops of a poorer character.
At first the workmen profited greatly, but as
is always the case conditions gradually settled back to
a normal state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general history of printing may be left at this
point. From this time on the conditions with which
we are familiar are coming into shape. The old day
with its old conditions has gone. We need to know the
history of these old times in order that we may understand
the records and experiences of the early day.
The later conditions we understand from our own
surroundings. The periodical literature which forms
so large a part of the output of the press has fairly come
to life by the end of the eighteenth century. Commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>printing, which is now entering upon so positive
a career of usefulness and importance, is about to begin.
The invention of the Stanhope press about 1800 is the
first of that long series of inventions which have
made possible the printing establishments of today and
their wonderful product. These things are elsewhere
treated. Here we say good-bye to our elder brothers
of the home-made type, the ink balls, and the hand press.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Supplementary Reading</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The material bearing on the economic history of
printing is very scattered. So far as the present
writer is aware there is no book on the subject in
English. The nearest approach to such a treatment
will perhaps be found in the second volume of Mr.
George Haven Putnam’s excellent book <cite>Books and
Their Makers in the Middle Ages</cite>. Some information
may be obtained from Mr. DeVinne’s <cite>Invention of
Printing</cite>; <cite>Notable Printers of Italy During the Fifteenth
Century</cite>; and <cite>Christopher Plantin and the Plantin-Moretus
Museum at Antwerp</cite>. The “Plantin” is a
publication of the Grolier Club, but may be found in
substance in <cite>The Century</cite> for June, 1888. Some very
excellent historical articles have been published in
recent years in <cite>The Inland Printer</cite> by Mr. Henry L.
Bullen and Mr. John Rittenour. The student will do
well to examine the files of this and other leading
trade journals for some years back and to consult the
local librarian for such material as may be found in
libraries.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The following questions, based on the contents of this pamphlet,
are intended to serve (1) as a guide to the study of the text, (2) as
an aid to the student in putting the information contained into
definite statements without actually memorizing the text, (3) as
a means of securing from the student a reproduction of the information
in his own words.</p>

<p class='c015'>A careful following of the questions by the reader will insure full
acquaintance with every part of the text, avoiding the accidental
omission of what might be of value. These primers are so condensed
that nothing should be omitted.</p>

<p class='c015'>In teaching from these books it is very important that these questions
and such others as may occur to the teacher should be made
the basis of frequent written work and of final examinations.</p>

<p class='c015'>The importance of written work cannot be overstated. It not
only assures knowledge of material but the power to express that
knowledge correctly and in good form.</p>

<p class='c015'>If this written work can be submitted to the teacher in printed
form it will be doubly useful.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES FOR APPRENTICES</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The following list of publications, comprising the <span class='sc'>Typographic
Technical Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared
under the supervision of the Committee on Education of the
United Typothetae of America for use in trade classes, in courses of
printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or
group of authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide
the printers of the United States—employers, journeymen,
and apprentices—with a comprehensive series of handy and
inexpensive compendiums of reliable, up-to-date information upon
the various branches and specialties of the printing craft, all
arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p class='c007'>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5 × 8 inches.
Their general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has
been, as far as practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief
synopsis of the particular contents and other chief features of each
volume will be found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to
embody in each publication as completely as possible all the
rudimentary information and essential facts necessary to an understanding
of the subject. Care has been taken to make all statements
accurate and clear, with the purpose of bringing essential
information within the understanding of beginners in the different
fields of study. Wherever practicable, simple and well-defined
drawings and illustrations have been used to assist in giving
additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible
help for use in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each
title is accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering
essential items of the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical
terms belonging to the subject or department treated is also
added to many of the books.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Address all orders and inquiries to <span class='sc'>Committee on Education,
United Typothetae of America, Chicago, Illinois, U. S. A.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the
splendid co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals
engaged in the printing business and its allied industries
in the United States of America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America, under whose auspices the books have been prepared and
published, acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance
rendered by the many authors, printers, and others identified
with this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright
pages of those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless
felt that a group list of co-operating firms would be of
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who
have co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed
(which the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list
will be printed in each volume.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to
the many subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its
publication.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
